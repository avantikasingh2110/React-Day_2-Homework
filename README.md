## ðŸŒˆ Features

- âœ¨ React with CDN: This project uses React and ReactDOM through CDN links, without a build process or Node.js setup.
- âœ¨ Dynamic Content: Topics and descriptions dynamically generated using React's createElement() method.
- âœ¨ Background Gradient: A visually appealing gradient for the background.
- âœ¨ Custom Fonts: Beautiful Google Fonts for unique text styling.
- âœ¨ Responsive Design: Ensures the content looks great across devices.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

**Technologies Used** <br>
ðŸ”¹ HTML - For the basic structure of the app. <br>
ðŸ”¹ CSS - For styling, gradients, and responsive design. <br>
ðŸ”¹ React (via CDN) - To create components and render them dynamically.<br>

## How It Works

This project leverages React's CDN setup, avoiding the need for complex tools like Webpack or a Node.js environment. The script files for React and ReactDOM are included directly in the HTML file.
